statusping
==========

StatusPing is a simple status bar tool for OSX that enables you to visually monitor a connection to a server using ICMP.

Just fill in the address of the remote server and the interval between ICMP packets (ping's).

This tool might be used to monitor connections in which your Mac is directly attached to a stable network device (router, access point) but the upstream connection of such device is unstable.
